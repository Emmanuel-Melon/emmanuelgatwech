        <p>Hi üñêüèæ, I'm</p>
        <h1>Emmanuel Daniel</h1>
        <p>
          I am a Full-Snack Developer from üá∏üá∏South Sudanüá∏üá∏ Friends call me Eman
          or JunubiMan which literally translates to "Southern Guy".
        </p>
        <h3>The Beginings</h3>
        <p>
          I wrote my first "Hello, World" in C on the 12th of September, 2015.{" "}
          <br />
          This was followed by a very long of making mistakes and learning from
          them to contiously grow to where I am at today.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few months later, I got introduced to HTML/CSS and JavaScript and I
          built my very first website (Wasn't very great to be honest).
          <br />I fell in love with the visual aspect of making things work in a
          browser so I learned how to develop Front-End applications in Angular
          2 and Ioninc. Fast forward, I need to process business logic so I
          learned how PHP worked and later on followed it by Node.js
        </p>
        <h3>The Now</h3>
        <p>
          I build Full-Stack applications from the ground up all the way to
          deployments.
        </p>
