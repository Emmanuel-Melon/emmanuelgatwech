          I am a Full-Snack Developer from ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¸South SudanðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¸ Friends call me Eman

        <h3>The Beginnings</h3>
        <p>
          I wrote my first "Hello, World" in C on the 12th of September, 2015.{" "}
          <br />
          This was followed by a very long of making mistakes and learning from
          them to captiously grow to where I am at today.
          <br />A few months later, I got introduced to HTML/CSS and JavaScript
          and I built my very first website; it wasn't so great but that's how I
          fell in love with Web Development.
        </p>
