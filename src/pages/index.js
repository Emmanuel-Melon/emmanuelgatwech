        <h1>Emmanuel Daniel</h1>
        <p>
          I am a Full-Snack Developer from ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¸South SudanðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¸ Friends call me Eman
          or JunubiMan which literally translates to "Southern Guy".
        </p>
        <h3>The Beginnings</h3>
        <p>
          I wrote my first "Hello, World" in C on the 12th of September, 2015.{" "}
          <br />
          This was followed by a very long of making mistakes and learning from
          them to captiously grow to where I am at today.
        <br />
          A few months later, I got introduced to HTML/CSS and JavaScript and I
          built my very first website; it wasn't so great but that's how I fell in love with Web Development.
        </p>
        <h3>The Now</h3>
        <p>
          I build Full-Stack applications from the ground up all the way to
          deployments.
        </p>
        <ul className='services'>
